We'd like you to record a new, 1-minute video of yourself either telling us about your presentation or giving a short sample of what your presentation will be like. It doesn't need to be anything fancy and can be shot from a webcam. Please upload this video to YouTube or Vimeo and paste the link below. Make sure to label your video as: "Your Name-TEDNYC14" eg "Sam Jackson-TEDNYC14". If you would like to keep your video private, please make sure to send us the password. *
 
How many minutes will you need for your audition presentation (3-8 mins)? Shorter may boost your chances, but be realistic. *
